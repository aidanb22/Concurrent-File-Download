# Concurrent Multi-part File Downloader

**Concurrent Multi-part File Downloader** is a Rust-based command-line tool that downloads large files from the internet by splitting them into parts and downloading them concurrently. This approach speeds up the download process and efficiently utilizes available bandwidth.

## Features:
- **Multi-part Downloads**: Download large files in multiple parts for faster and more efficient transfers.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback with a progress bar showing overall download progress.
- **Customizable**: Specify the number of parts to split the file into and the file URL via command-line arguments.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors, with retries for failed parts.
