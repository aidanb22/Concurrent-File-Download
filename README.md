Features:
* Multi-part Downloads: Download large files in multiple parts for faster and more efficient transfers.
* Progress Tracking: Visual feedback with a progress bar showing overall download progress.
  * Customizable: Specify the number of parts to split the file into and the file URL via command-line arguments.
* Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors, with retries for failed parts.
